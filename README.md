2. Write a program to remove duplicate elements from a given array. [***Done***](https://github.com/Ansh-Kushwaha/IV-SEM-Repo/blob/main/ADA/Lab%20Programs/RemoveDuplicates.cpp)
3. Write a program to merge two sorted arrays. [***Done***](https://github.com/Ansh-Kushwaha/IV-SEM-Repo/blob/main/ADA/Lab%20Programs/Merge.cpp)
4. Write a program to find common elements in two different arrays. [***Done***](https://github.com/Ansh-Kushwaha/IV-SEM-Repo/blob/main/ADA/Lab%20Programs/CommomElements.cpp)
5. Write a program to find elements that are in one array but not present in second array. [***Done***](https://github.com/Ansh-Kushwaha/IV-SEM-Repo/blob/main/ADA/Lab%20Programs/SetDifference.cpp)
6. Write a program to implement iterative and recursive procedure to find greatest element in the list.
7. Write a program to implement bubble and insertion sort and how these algorithms can be made efficient.
